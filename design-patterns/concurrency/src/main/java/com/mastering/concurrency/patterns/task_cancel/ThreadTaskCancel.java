/**
 * Pattern: Thread Task Cancel
 * <p>
 * Motivations: Tasks that offers a cancel option are common in programming.
 * Background tasks, implemented by threads, are common in Java too and often
 * they need to be canceled.
 * <p>
 * Intent: Show how to create a cancel mechanism using threads. Inside the
 * Runnable code, we use Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() to identify the
 * thread state and to keep it running or not.
 * <p>
 * Applicability: When background tasks needs a cancel option.
